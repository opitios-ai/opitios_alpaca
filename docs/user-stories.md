# User Stories - Opitios Alpaca Critical Issues

## Epic 1: Account Management and Security

### Story: ACC-001 - Account Type Detection System
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** automatic detection of paper vs live trading accounts  
**So that** I can ensure proper regulatory compliance and risk management

**Acceptance Criteria** (EARS format):
- **WHEN** the system initializes an account connection **THEN** it automatically detects if the account is paper trading (ID starts with "PA") or live trading
- **IF** an account ID starts with "PA" **THEN** the system classifies it as paper trading account
- **IF** an account ID does not start with "PA" **THEN** the system classifies it as live trading account
- **FOR** all account configurations **VERIFY** that account type is logged during initialization
- **WHEN** account type is detected **THEN** it is stored in AccountConfig and available via API endpoints
- **IF** account type detection fails **THEN** system logs error and defaults to safe mode (paper trading)

**Technical Notes**:
- Implement in AccountConfig class within app/account_pool.py
- Add account_type field to account configuration
- Include account type in connection pool statistics
- Ensure account type is logged with all trading operations

### Story: ACC-002 - Trading Balance Validation
**As a** risk manager  
**I want** to prevent trading when account balance is below minimum threshold  
**So that** we avoid over-trading and account depletion

**Acceptance Criteria** (EARS format):
- **WHEN** a trading operation is initiated **THEN** system checks current cash balance against minimum threshold
- **IF** cash balance is below configured minimum ($5000 default) **THEN** trading operation is rejected with clear error message
- **FOR** all trading operations (stocks and options) **VERIFY** balance validation is performed
- **WHEN** balance check fails due to API error **THEN** system logs error and allows trade with warning
- **IF** minimum balance threshold is not configured **THEN** system uses default value of $5000
- **WHEN** balance validation fails **THEN** system logs account details and attempted operation

**Technical Notes**:
- Add balance validation to AlpacaClient before order submission
